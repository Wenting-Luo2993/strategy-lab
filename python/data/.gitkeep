This folder contains the SQLite trading database and related data files.

## Files (git ignored):
- `trades.db` - Main trading database
- `trades.db-shm` - SQLite shared memory file
- `trades.db-wal` - SQLite write-ahead log file
- `backups/` - Local database backups (before cloud sync)

## Purpose:
